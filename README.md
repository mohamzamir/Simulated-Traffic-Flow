# Traffic Congestion Modeling Tool

 ## Project Overview
 The Traffic Congestion Modeling Tool is a Java Simulator that is designed to calculate the path a person takes given an input list of cities and roads, along with their carrying capacities in terms of cars per minute. This tool is useful in modeling traffic flows and congestion in various cities.

 The solution is optimized to calculate the maximum flow between two cities using Depth First Search (DFS) and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithms. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is also used to efficiently determine the shortest path.

 ## Dependencies
 Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or later) <br>
 Apache Maven (3.6.3 or later) <br>

 ## Installation
 Clone the repo
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mohamzamir/Traffic-Congestion-Modeling-Tool
 ```

 ## Usage
 To use the Traffic Congestion Modeling Tool, run the Java simulator with a list of cities and a list of roads from various cities, along with their carrying capacities in terms of cars per minute.

 ## Implementation
 The Java Simulator is built to manage and calculate traffic flows. It accepts a list of cities and roads as input, along with the maximum capacity of each road.

 The maximum flow between two cities is calculated using the DFS and Ford-Fulkerson algorithms, providing an optimized solution for high-density traffic conditions. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is implemented to determine the shortest path between two cities, further improving the tool's efficiency.
